# Abstract

The Hackathon Dashboard project aims to build a comprehensive platform that aggregates information about various hackathons from popular websites like Devpost, Devfolio, and MLH (Major League Hacking). The goal is to enable users to easily discover and filter hackathons based on location, registration status, submission deadlines, and mode (online/offline). 

So far, the project has successfully scraped hackathon data from Devpost and Devfolio, and work is underway to scrape MLH. A frontend interface has been developed using Streamlit, allowing users to filter hackathons based on the aforementioned criteria. The information displayed includes the title, organizing body, location, submission period, prize amount, and the URL to the hackathons official page.

# Future Work

Moving forward, the project will explore automation and orchestration tools such as MageAI or Apache Airflow to schedule web scraping tasks on a daily basis. This will ensure that the hackathon data is always up-to-date without manual intervention. Additionally, we will explore options for hosting the project, with a preference for utilizing GitHub for both data storage and version control, ensuring easy collaboration and deployment.

Further enhancements will include optimizing the data cleaning process, expanding the platform to include more hackathon sources, and refining the user interface to improve usability and feature accessibility.
